* fix the bug that makes the game crash
* sound effects
  - atom collision
  - landing on a surface
  - atoms asploding
* theme music
* preview the atoms before they drop
* set up to follow rules/instructions


* weapons:
  - uncork
  - scissors
  - acid
  - radiation
  - mess with gravity
  - mess with mass





Brainstorming:

Weapons. These need icons as well as weapon-specific art.

 * Bomb / Explosive.

   Drop this in the other player's tank and it will explode,
   destroying bonds and generally causing chaos by shuffling things around.

   Will also need art for the actual bomb that will be dropped, bonus points
   if the fuse is animated.

   Also need an explosion animation, but we can always use this stock explosion
   animation that I have.

 * Some sort of thing that temporarily opens up a gap in the other player's
   tank, causing atoms to leak out. On my scratch pad I drew some scissors,
   but there's probably a better way to represent this weapon using the
   mad science theme.

   Cuts the side off tank temporarily, things leak out.

   Can be used vertically or horizontally (maybe these are different powerups.
   in fact, I think they should be.)

   Allows attacking player to choose the location of the rip.

   Level 1, 2, and 3 - higher levels open up bigger gaps.

   Will need to figure out how selecting the position to cut should look.
   Might need to change the background image, or pull part of it out
   so we can treat it separately.

 * Acid (on my paper I drew a bubbly potion)

   Pours into other player's tank, eroding atoms and destroying bonds.

   Need art for the acid substance that you see falling into the tank.
   I'm thinking it can be a different looking atom, and then bubbles
   pop up and fade away along with the atoms it is eroding.

 * A Rock

   Drop a bunch of these into the enemy tank because they take up space,
   get in the way, and don't help them win.

 * Teleportation

   Activate to teleport into enemy tank for a limited amount of time so you
   can fuck up their shit.

   Would be cool to have a flash and a cloud of smoke for effect. Pretty low
   priority.

 * Radiation

   Changes atom colors around randomly.

   Really annoying.

   $$$


Defenses (also need icons and art) - very low priority at this point:

 * Double Bond

   Doesn't break.

 * Steel Reinforced Walls

   Can't use scissors or whatever on it.

 * Speed Boost

   Makes you move faster.

 * Double Gun

   Can stack up to 2 atoms instead of 1.
